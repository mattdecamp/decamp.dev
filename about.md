# A bit about me:

My name is Matt DeCamp, a front-end web developer and music industry professional based in Athens, Georgia.

While my web experience dates back to the age of [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities), I've been building websites professionally for a little over a decade for clients and friends across industries.

## You mentioned the music industry...

Yes! For the last fifteen years I have been an active member of the local Athens music scene as an artist manager, digital marketer, recording engineer and overall ally of musicians and performers.

In that time my primary occupation has been as the Digital and Archive Manager for the band [Widespread Panic](https://widespreadpanic.com).

## Okay, more about the web stuff

In 2020, after over a decade of building and tuning up websites in my spare time, I established <a href="https://happybear.dev">Happy Bear</a>, a boutique web design shop here in Athens. If you're interested in learning more about what I do there, I'd love to <a href="mailto:matt@happybear.dev">hear from you</a>.

## Offline

When I'm not coding I am hanging out with my wife, our son and our cattle dog.

I'm a [voracious music listener](https://open.spotify.com/user/mattbrowncat); longtime guitar player; [avid reader](/books); a swimming and running enthusiast; and a budding photographer.

I also love [absurdist humor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZJZK6rzjns) and [a good cup of coffee](https://counterculturecoffee.com/shop/coffee/forty-six).
