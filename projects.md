# A little bit about me:

My name is Matt DeCamp, a front-end web developer and music industry professional based in Athens, Georgia. 

Though my web experience dates back to the age of Geocities, I've been building websites for a little over a decade now for clients and friends across industries.

My goals with every project I work on 

## You mentioned the music industry, though...

Yes! For the last fifteen years I've been an active member of the local Athens music scene as artist manager, digital marketer, recording engineer and all around ally of musicians and performers.

For the past fifteen years I have primarily working as the Digital and Archive Manager for the band [Widespread Panic](https://widespreadpanic.com).

## Okay, more about the web stuff

I'm in the middle of a professional transition from the music industry to web development. Though I've been a part of the tech industry for most of my professional life, it isn't quite a living yet.
