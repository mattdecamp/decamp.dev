# A bit about me:

My name is Matt DeCamp, a front-end web developer and music industry professional based in Athens, Georgia. 

My web experience dates back to the age of [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities), I've been building websites professionally for a little over a decade for clients and friends across industries.

## You mentioned the music industry...

Yes! For the last fifteen years I have been an active member of the local Athens music scene as an artist manager, digital marketer, recording engineer and an ally of musicians and performers.

In that time my primary occupation has been as the Digital and Archive Manager for the band [Widespread Panic](https://widespreadpanic.com).

## Okay, more about the web stuff

I am actually in the middle of a professional transition from the music industry to web development. Though I've been a part of the tech industry for most of my professional life, only now am I making the shift to it full-time.

When I'm not on the computer I am hanging out with my wife, our son and cattle dog.
