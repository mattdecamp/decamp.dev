 _The goal in this series is to shed light on the process of building my website: the development set-up, the tools used, and the invaluable* resources that helped me along the way._

### Part 1: Dynamic or Static?

In a decade of building websites for others, I've never allowed myself the time to build my own. But if I put something off long enough, I'll finally wake up one day, put my head down and do it out of sheer frustration with myself.

Going into the project blind without some level of direction would've left me with a site I'd end up tinkering with for months. So I set some basic time constraints: It had to be something I could work on in my free evenings and be ready to launch within a month's time. It also had to have to tick these boxes:

* CSS from scratch
* Fast and Lighthouse-worthy
* An engaging, straightforward design
* Built with a static site generator

The bulk of my work as a web dev has been building sites that run on WordPress. Static sites have never really been what the clients call for, so for me opportunities to jump into the static site world had never happened. Sure, it was tempting to just go ahead and build another WordPress site. But now I was the client, and I demanded static!

In fact I came to the static decision a long time before I got around to building this dang thing. And I figured when I finally got around to it, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) would be the way to go. Then late last year I started to see a lot of good write-ups and some [fantastic](https://hylia.website/) [starter](https://github.com/philhawksworth/eleventyone) [sites](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/). 

After digging into [the documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/) and running some test sites locally, I saw Eleventy as the way to go. The fact I could come in and use virtually [whatever template language I wanted](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) was a huge appeal. So was the clear and concise Eleventy documentation. Oh yeah, and it's [crazy fast](https://www.11ty.dev/leaderboard/perf/).

But before I could jump into any of the coding I needed to actually work out what this site was going to look like.
