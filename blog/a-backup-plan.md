# A Backup Plan

_How I look after my data.......backup my data and h I made the plan_

At one point or another we all have a data disaster. A hard drive fails, our phone takes a bath, or one day your computer straight up won't boot up. It can be absolutely devastating; your digital house burning down. 

Depite the underlying risks of having digitized lives, looking after one's data can be a tedious task. Thankfully there are lots of services out there nowadays that can do much of the leg work for us. 

After years of doing the bare minimum to look after my own personal data, I recently put my figurative foot down and made a plan.

## My Goals

For starters I needed to layout the reasons why I wanted to do this in the first place.

* To ensure the safety of my data well into the future; especially the pieces I would never want to lose.
* Establish better personal backup habits and make it a more routine part of my day-to-day life. 

## Types of Data

Next I wanted to identify just what types of data I had and what they meant to me.

### The Important Stuff

All data is important to me on some level, otherwise why would I even have it. But this is the stuff I don't ever want to lose: family photos and videos, personal data and valuable documents. If my house was on fire, these are the things I'd be grabbing on my way out.

### The Everyday Stuff

This is the data I access most often: work documents, project files, audio recordings, and writings. I would need easy access to this data also would want these backed up on the regular and living somewhere other than on my computer.

### The Replaceable Data

Things like applications, node-modules, forks, etc. Stuff that I have copies of, but originate from somewhere else. If they disappeared tomorrow it wouldn't the end-of-the-world. I could always retrieve them from elsewhere if I needed to.

### Device Data

AKA looking after my devices. Getting into good habits with daily/weekly backups and reducing the overall risk shoudl some awful fate befall my computer or phone. 

## The Tools

Knowing the types of data I had I then turned to the tools and services I could use to look after the data. So I considered the following: 

### Hard Drives / Time Machine

### Cloud Services

### Off-site Backups

### Long term storage disks

### Plain ol' good backup habits

/// talk about each in turn and lead the way to storage vs. backup

## Redundancy, Data Storage and Data Backup



* 
* 
* Computer backup
  * Better safe than sorry; You can slways get a new computer; Hook it up at the end of the day; once a week at least
* Device backups
  * Same as computer; what's on there that you can't lose?; once a month at least; Hook it up and be done with it; consider it quality time without your phone;
* Short Term data
  * The items I'll need tomorrow or a month from now; work projects; photos; videos; Dropbox sync balance; pulling in what I need locally and keeping the rest online;
* Long Term Data 
  * The things I don't want to risk losing; the pieces most important to me; photos; video; important documents; archived recordings; Something easy to access but my digital attic I only need to check on every once in a while; Download the app, backup the important things, make a plan for the rest, press backup and forget about it.

/It was prompted by my desire to migrate my work files from Google Drive over to Dropbox.
