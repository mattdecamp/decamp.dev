# A Backup Plan

_My search and ultimate implementing of a plan to look after my data_

At one time or another we've all had those data disasters. A hard drive fails, your phone takes a bath, or one day your computer straight up would not boot up. It can be absolutely devastating; your digital house burning down. Depite experiencing data losses like these first-hand, data maintenance has remained a process that I've put off again and again. 

This month I sought to fix that.

## The Data Types

To begin I needed to identify the types of data I had:

### The Important Stuff

All your data is important to you on some level; But this is the stuff you don't ever want to lose. In my case this was family photos and videos, personal data and valuable documents. If your house was on fire, these are the things you'd want to carry out with you.

### The Everyday Stuff

This is the data you access most often. For me this is work documents, projects, audio recordings, and writings. This calls for a kind of balance because I needed easy access but I also wanted these backed up and living somewhere other than my computer.

### The Replaceable Data

Things like computer applications, node-modules, forks. Stuff that I have copies of, but originate somewhere else. If they disappeared tomorrow it wouldn't the end-of-the-world. I could always get other copies.

### Device Data

AKA looking after my devices. Getting into good habits with daily/weekly backups and reducing the overall risk shoudl some awful fate befall my computer or phone. 

## The Tools

Knowing the types of data I had I then turned to the tools and services I could use to look after the data. So I considered the following: 

### Hard Drives / Time Machine

### Cloud Services

### Off-site Backups

### Long term storage disks

### Plain ol' good backup habits

/// talk about each in turn and lead the way to storage vs. backup

## Redundancy, Data Storage and Data Backup



* 
* 
* Computer backup
  * Better safe than sorry; You can slways get a new computer; Hook it up at the end of the day; once a week at least
* Device backups
  * Same as computer; what's on there that you can't lose?; once a month at least; Hook it up and be done with it; consider it quality time without your phone;
* Short Term data
  * The items I'll need tomorrow or a month from now; work projects; photos; videos; Dropbox sync balance; pulling in what I need locally and keeping the rest online;
* Long Term Data 
  * The things I don't want to risk losing; the pieces most important to me; photos; video; important documents; archived recordings; Something easy to access but my digital attic I only need to check on every once in a while; Download the app, backup the important things, make a plan for the rest, press backup and forget about it.
