            Hi, I'm Matt

        <p>
            I am a Web Developer and Music Industry Professional based in Athens, Georgia.
        </p>
        <p>
            For over a decade I have been building websites professionally for clients and friends across many industries.

            And for the last fifteen years I have been an active member of the Athens music scene as an artist manager, digital marketer, recording enginer, and ally of musicians and performers.
